Hello! My name is Victoria and I enjoy creating things for the internet.

My interest in web development started back in 2012 when I decided to try customizing my Tumblr blog â€” turns out hacking together a custom music player taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!

Fast-forward to today, I recently graduated from the University of Virginia as a Chemistry and Computer Science double major. There, I developed an interest for medicine and technology, and have thought of combining these two passions. I was able to obtain hands on experience working with patient databases such as Epic Systems and Patient Fusion working as an inpatient oncology volunteer and medical scribe. I am also a full-time stroke victim caretaker.

Learning to work with these newer technologies have helped prepare me to become a quick and adaptive learner. I started small, learning about front-end development and website design by creating my Sorority's website. From there, I began to build more advanced projects from programming a robot, to programming a face-recognition application using AWS. Learn more about my technical work below.
